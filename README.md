### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eric, a software engineer from Knoxville, TN. Here are a few facts about me:

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that will help me learn and grow as a developer
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm really into good coffee (hit me up if you know of a project integrating coffee and code!)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Sass and Next.js
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about live coding - programming music/visuals on the fly (it's a seriously fun hobby)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: etkndr@gmail.com
